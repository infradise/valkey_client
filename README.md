# `valkey_client`

[](https://pub.dev/packages/valkey_client)

A modern, production-ready Dart client for Valkey (9.0.0+). Fully Redis 7.x compatible.

-----

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Active Development

**This package is currently a placeholder to reserve the name on `pub.dev`.**

It is under active development and is **not yet ready for production use**. Do not use this in a production environment until version 1.0.0 is released.

## The Goal üéØ

The Dart ecosystem needs a high-performance, actively maintained client for the next generation of in-memory databases. This package aims to be the standard Dart client for **Valkey (9.0.0+)** while maintaining full compatibility with **Redis (7.x+)**.

It is designed primarily for server-side Dart applications (`server.dart`) requiring a robust and fast connection to Valkey.

## Planned Features

  * **Valkey 9.0.0+ Support:** Full implementation of the latest commands and features.
  * **RESP3 Protocol:** Built on the modern RESP3 protocol for richer data types and performance.
  * **High-Performance Async I/O:** Non-blocking, asynchronous networking.
  * **Connection Pooling:** Production-grade connection pooling suitable for high-concurrency backend servers.
  * **Type-Safe & Modern API:** A clean, easy-to-use API for Dart developers.
